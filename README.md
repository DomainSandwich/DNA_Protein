# DNA To Protein
This C++ program takes in a DNA sequence as an input, and then prints out the corresponding mRNA sequence, as well as printing the corresponding protein sequence.
Specifically, by using a three-dimensional map, we are able to store the related amino acid for each mRNA codon. 
Exception handling is used to catch possible errors, such as invalid nitrogenous bases provided in the DNA sequence, or the absence of a start codon or end codon. These coding practices are meant to reflect that of the true biological processes of transcription and translation.

For Use:

1. Be sure that you enter the DNA strand with valid nitrogenous bases. (Either uppercase or lowercase is fine)
2. Just for your information, the code isn't written in the main function, but rather in a function called DNA_To_Protein. If you are looking for a text file, look at the attached files. One of them has the pure code, and one of them has the code, without the function!

Thanks! Hope you enjoy the program!
